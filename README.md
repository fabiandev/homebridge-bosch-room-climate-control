# homebridge-bosch-room-climate-control

The HomeKit integration of Bosch Smart Home Thermostats is quite limited. Currently it is not possible to control thermostats that are grouped into a room (room climate control), to switch between manual and automatic mode, or to turn the thermostats on and off.

Further documentation on how to configure and use this Homebridge plugin will be added soon will be added soon, before releasing to npm.
